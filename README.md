Send to pager: READ ME

With this basic pager app I was able to consolidate a number of points with JS , CSS Grid and CSS flexbox. 
I also used the setTimeout() method to delay the pager transmission and I included an audio file to ‘play’when the pager ‘received’ the incoming message from the input.
